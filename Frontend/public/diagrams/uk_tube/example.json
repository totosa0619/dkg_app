In addition, the first three years provide an average annual production of 205,000 ounces with a cash cost of US$437/oz resulting in a rapid project payback of 2.2 years.

They are the first company to automate drug design, surpassing conventional human endeavor. Their AI-driven systems actively learn best practice from vast repositories of discovery data and are further enhanced with knowledge acquired from seasoned drug hunters. With better information to hand than any researcher could acquire individually, their knowledge-driven systems design millions of novel, project-specific compounds and pre-assess each for predicted potency, selectivity, ADME and other key criteria. From this, a selection of the best, information-rich compounds are selected for synthesis and assay. With new experimental data generated, the results are integrated and the next design cycle initiated. Rapid design-make-test cycles ensure unparalleled progress towards desired project goals. Exscientia has already delivered exceptional productivity, generating candidates in roughly one-quarter of the time of traditional approaches.",

The company's growth since the time of its spin-off from Noble Affiliates in 1985 has come about through a series of strategic acquisitions of offshore drilling assets. These acquisitions follow the goals originally set forth in 1985: to gain a strong position in foreign drilling markets, expand marine drilling operations, and move into new markets and segments of the industry, preparing the company to take advantage of an improved marketplace. Noble has been successful by maintaining a conservative financial policy, positioning itself to adapt to the ever-changing world energy market, and meeting customers' needs and demands. At the same time, the company has assimilated an experienced and well-trained workforce. Lloyd Noble set the tone for the company's employee-oriented attitude as a legacy for management.",
